ID-PHPSentiAnalysis - Indonesian Sentiment Analysis in PHP
---------

This is an Indonesian Sentiment Classifier. Originated by James Hennessey and other contributors in phpInsight - Sentiment Analysis in PHP Project (https://github.com/JWHennessey/phpInsight). Some changes are made in the dataset (lib/PHPInsight/dictionaries and lib/PHPInsight/data) that originally use English Langguage converted to Indonesian Langguage. 

To be spesific, the list of words of positive and negative in lib/PHPInsight/dictionaries and lib/PHPInsight/data are generated by using modified Devid Haryalesmana's list of words on his project, ID-OpinionWords (https://github.com/masdevid/ID-OpinionWords).
